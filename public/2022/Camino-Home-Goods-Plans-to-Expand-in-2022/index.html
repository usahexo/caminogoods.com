This was according to the company’s CEO, Dylan Greene.</p>
<p>“We are planning to open new stores in 2022. We have not finalized the locations yet, but they will be in strategic areas that will allow us to serve our customers better,” said Greene.</p>
<p>This is great news for Camino Home Goods customers. The company has been expanding rapidly over the past few years and now has stores in several states.</p>
<p>The new stores will offer a wider selection of products and services than what is currently available at the existing stores. In addition, they will also provide a better shopping experience for customers.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to provide a unique shopping experience for our customers that they cannot find at other home goods stores,” said Greene. “We want them to feel like they are walking into a boutique rather than a traditional home goods store.”</p>
<p>The new stores will also have a more modern look and feel. This is in line with the current trend of shoppers wanting retail spaces that are more stylish and inviting.</p>
<p>“We are constantly looking for ways to improve the customer experience,” said Greene. “The new stores will help us do just that.”</p>

This comes as the company finishes up a $10 million investment round, which will be used to fuel store growth.</p>
<p>“We’re seeing great success with our store model and are looking to accelerate our growth through 2022,” said CEO Jake Rice. “This capital raise is going to help us do just that.”</p>
<p>Camino currently operates 14 stores in six states. The company plans to have 25 stores by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>The chain is well-known for its mix of modern and classic furniture, as well as its range of home goods. It has been growing rapidly in recent years, thanks in part to its focus on ecommerce and omni-channel retailing.</p>
<p>“Our approach is really resonating with customers,” said Rice. “They appreciate the unique mix of products we offer along with our focus on customer service.”</p>
